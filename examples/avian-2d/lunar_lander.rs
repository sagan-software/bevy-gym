//! ## Description
//! This environment is a classic rocket trajectory optimization problem.
//! According to Pontryagin's maximum principle, it is optimal to fire the
//! engine at full throttle or turn it off. This is the reason why this
//! environment has discrete actions: engine on or off.
//!
//! There are two environment versions: discrete or continuous.
//! The landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). The coordinates are the
//! first two numbers in the state vector.
//! Landing outside of the landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent
//! can learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.
//!
//! To see a heuristic landing, run:
//! ```shell
//! python gymnasium/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py
//! ```
//!
//! ## Action Space
//! There are four discrete actions available:
//! - 0: do nothing
//! - 1: fire left orientation engine
//! - 2: fire main engine
//! - 3: fire right orientation engine
//!
//! ## Observation Space
//! The state is an 8-dimensional vector: the coordinates of the lander in `x` & `y`, its linear
//! velocities in `x` & `y`, its angle, its angular velocity, and two booleans
//! that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.
//!
//! ## Rewards
//! After every step a reward is granted. The total reward of an episode is the
//! sum of the rewards for all the steps within that episode.
//!
//! For each step, the reward:
//! - is increased/decreased the closer/further the lander is to the landing pad.
//! - is increased/decreased the slower/faster the lander is moving.
//! - is decreased the more the lander is tilted (angle not horizontal).
//! - is increased by 10 points for each leg that is in contact with the ground.
//! - is decreased by 0.03 points each frame a side engine is firing.
//! - is decreased by 0.3 points each frame the main engine is firing.
//!
//! The episode receive an additional reward of -100 or +100 points for crashing or landing safely respectively.
//!
//! An episode is considered a solution if it scores at least 200 points.
//!
//! ## Starting State
//! The lander starts at the top center of the viewport with a random initial
//! force applied to its center of mass.
//!
//! ## Episode Termination
//! The episode finishes if:
//! 1) the lander crashes (the lander body gets in contact with the moon);
//! 2) the lander gets outside of the viewport (`x` coordinate is greater than 1);
//! 3) the lander is not awake. From the [Box2D docs](https://box2d.org/documentation/md_simulation.html),
//!    a body which is not awake is a body which doesn't move and doesn't collide with any other body:
//! > When Box2D determines that a body (or group of bodies) has come to rest,
//! > the body enters a sleep state which has very little CPU overhead. If a
//! > body is awake and collides with a sleeping body, then the sleeping body
//! > wakes up. Bodies will also wake up if a joint or contact attached to
//! > them is destroyed.
//!
//! ## Arguments
//!
//! Lunar Lander has a large number of arguments
//!
//! ```python
//! >>> import gymnasium as gym
//! >>> env = gym.make("LunarLander-v3", continuous=False, gravity=-10.0,
//! ...                enable_wind=False, wind_power=15.0, turbulence_power=1.5)
//! >>> env
//! <TimeLimit<OrderEnforcing<PassiveEnvChecker<LunarLander<LunarLander-v3>>>>>
//!
//! ```
//!
//!  * `continuous` determines if discrete or continuous actions (corresponding to the throttle of the engines) will be used with the
//!  action space being `Discrete(4)` or `Box(-1, +1, (2,), dtype=np.float32)` respectively.
//!  For continuous actions, the first coordinate of an action determines the throttle of the main engine, while the second
//!  coordinate specifies the throttle of the lateral boosters. Given an action `np.array([main, lateral])`, the main
//!  engine will be turned off completely if `main < 0` and the throttle scales affinely from 50% to 100% for
//!  `0 <= main <= 1` (in particular, the main engine doesn't work  with less than 50% power).
//!  Similarly, if `-0.5 < lateral < 0.5`, the lateral boosters will not fire at all. If `lateral < -0.5`, the left
//!  booster will fire, and if `lateral > 0.5`, the right booster will fire. Again, the throttle scales affinely
//!  from 50% to 100% between -1 and -0.5 (and 0.5 and 1, respectively).
//!
//! * `gravity` dictates the gravitational constant, this is bounded to be within 0 and -12. Default is -10.0
//!
//! * `enable_wind` determines if there will be wind effects applied to the lander. The wind is generated using
//!  the function `tanh(sin(2 k (t+C)) + sin(pi k (t+C)))` where `k` is set to 0.01 and `C` is sampled randomly between -9999 and 9999.
//!
//! * `wind_power` dictates the maximum magnitude of linear wind applied to the craft. The recommended value for
//!  `wind_power` is between 0.0 and 20.0.
//!
//! * `turbulence_power` dictates the maximum magnitude of rotational wind applied to the craft.
//!  The recommended value for `turbulence_power` is between 0.0 and 2.0.
//!
//! ## Version History
//! - v3:
//!     - Reset wind and turbulence offset (`C`) whenever the environment is reset to ensure statistical independence between consecutive episodes (related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/954)).
//!     - Fix non-deterministic behaviour due to not fully destroying the world (related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/728)).
//!     - Changed observation space for `x`, `y`  coordinates from $\pm 1.5$ to $\pm 2.5$, velocities from $\pm 5$ to $\pm 10$ and angles from $\pm \pi$ to $\pm 2\pi$ (related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/752)).
//! - v2: Count energy spent and in v0.24, added turbulence with wind power and turbulence_power parameters
//! - v1: Legs contact with ground added in state vector; contact with ground give +10 reward points, and -10 if then lose contact; reward renormalized to 200; harder initial random push.
//! - v0: Initial version
//!
//! ## Notes
//!
//! There are several unexpected bugs with the implementation of the environment.
//!
//! 1. The position of the side thrusters on the body of the lander changes, depending on the orientation of the lander.
//! This in turn results in an orientation dependent torque being applied to the lander.
//!
//! 2. The units of the state are not consistent. I.e.
//! * The angular velocity is in units of 0.4 radians per second. In order to convert to radians per second, the value needs to be multiplied by a factor of 2.5.
//!
//! For the default values of VIEWPORT_W, VIEWPORT_H, SCALE, and FPS, the scale factors equal:
//! 'x': 10, 'y': 6.666, 'vx': 5, 'vy': 7.5, 'angle': 1, 'angular velocity': 2.5
//!
//! After the correction has been made, the units of the state are as follows:
//! 'x': (units), 'y': (units), 'vx': (units/second), 'vy': (units/second), 'angle': (radians), 'angular velocity': (radians/second)
