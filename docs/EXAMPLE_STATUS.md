# Examples execution status

Updated: 2026-10-08. Goal status: active.

## Resume here

Read [the roadmap](EXAMPLE_ROADMAP.md), [quality audit](QUALITY_AUDIT.md),
[reference research](EXAMPLE_RESEARCH.md), and [drone contract](ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT.md).
Continue P1 with a Bevy scene driven by `DroneHover`, then browser rollout comparison
and learned hover. The headless foundation is implemented. Rendered flight,
perception, damage adaptation, pursuit, and the jumping quadruped remain pending.
Do not start later port families before the custom robot milestones.

Working checkout: `/home/sagan/Code/github.com/sagan-software/bevy-gym-quality`.
Branch: `quality-roadmap-20261008`. Baseline: `232e801`.
Original checkout: `/home/sagan/Code/github.com/sagan-software/bevy-gym`.
It has 1,304 staged deletions, four additions, and three untracked example folders.
Preserve its index and working files. Do not use `git add -A` there.

GitHub remote is `github`; `origin` is a separate GitLab repository. Publish
authorized milestones to GitHub `main`. Configured identity is Bill Curry,
`bill@sagan.software`. Inspect author, committer, message, and trailers before
finalizing each commit. Never add AI attribution.

## Completed work

- Created the persistent goal, isolated worktree, complete roadmap, and initial audit.
  No matching tracked reviewer instructions were found outside the `ai` instructions.
  Root `AGENTS.md` is an ignored broken Nix-store symlink; use session instructions.
- Inventoried all 23 Gymnasium reference sheets. Located pinned Unity scenes and
  all eleven Godot README-video source folders and per-example notices.
- Downloaded and inspected all 17 Unity images and eleven Godot videos through
  individual 20-frame contact sheets. Verified the 28 media hashes.
- Downloaded the official ARC Raiders documentary and Leaper gameplay. Inspected
  aerial, damage, locomotion, training, and dense motion sheets. A continuous
  jump clip remains necessary for measured timing. Both video hashes are recorded.
- Verified AI Warehouse's public README says its example code is private.
- Confirmed installed `yt-dlp` 2026.08.19 and FFmpeg. `yt-dlp` is already committed
  in NixOS dotfiles at `modules/dev/default.nix:156`; T490 enables that module.
  No dotfiles edit or activation is needed.
- Retained Nate Gazzard's CC BY 3.0 quadrotor GLB, license, attribution, and motor map.
  Inspected its four named rotors and 4,564 triangles in a rendered view and video.
  Shared the [screenshot](progress/drone-model.png) and
  [turntable recording](progress/drone-model.mp4) with the user. These show asset
  inspection, not Bevy flight or learned control.
- Allowed `unused_crate_dependencies` and removed bare dependency-only imports
  from 45 existing example files. Extension-trait imports remain named.
- Reproduced and fixed cross-environment automatic resets and overwritten seed
  schedules. Five external regression tests protect isolation and reset lifecycle.
- Implemented the optional `robots` module with validated `DroneAction`, read-only
  `DroneObservation`, and a private Rapier 0.36 world in `DroneHover`.
  The 28-line guide demonstrates a seeded, time-limited constant hover command.
- Added native robot tests and a robot WASM compile check to CI.

## Verification

Passed after the source changes:

- `nix develop --command cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- `nix develop --command cargo test`: 119 unit/integration tests and two documentation
  tests passed. One existing plugin documentation example remains ignored.
- `nix develop --command cargo test --features robots --lib --test drone_hover`:
  87 library tests and eight external drone tests passed.
- `nix develop --command cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- `nix develop --command cargo check --no-default-features --features robots,browser --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- Focused branch coverage: 87 library tests, eight drone tests, and five reset tests.
  All new drone source lines and branches were hit. All 339 instrumented added
  source lines were hit, including internal test code. The changed reset and step
  source files have full line and branch coverage. Source hashes and exact scope
  are in [the coverage record](progress/drone-foundation-coverage.json).
- The personal lint suite reports no diagnostics on changed lines against `9cc5672`.
  Its command uses `--rust --package bevy-gym --all-targets --all-features --no-deps
  --extra-rustc-arg=-Aunused_crate_dependencies --changed-range 9cc5672` through the
  installed `scripts/nix-safe run lint -- --repo` entry point.

The full-package personal gate remains unresolved: 50 errors and two warnings
outside changed lines. [The audit](QUALITY_AUDIT.md) and
[diagnostic inventory](progress/personal-lint-backlog.json) retain them. The scoped
pass does not override that failure. Full Nix flake checks have not run in this audit.

The headless guide passed: seed 42 retained position
`(0.096625954, 1.931982, -0.088559546)` metres across ten simulated seconds.
`cargo test --features robots --doc` passed four tests, including both new
compile-fail guards; one existing plugin example remains ignored. Changed Markdown
and Cargo TOML checks pass. The remaining CI commands also passed: both Python
contract/dependency checks, robot tests without default features, both browser
package test suites, and browser-package Clippy for native and WASM targets.
Opt-in long training qualification tests remain ignored by their existing configuration.
No drone browser execution, trained policy, or new deployment is qualified yet.

Earlier missing-API tests failed with `E0432` before production code existed.
The initial reset regressions also failed before their fixes. These logs are retained
as `drone-red.log` and `reset-red.log`. Runtime coverage does not replace the
compile-fail checks for unchecked action construction and raw-world access.

## Browser and visual status

T3 preview is available. Inspected the official Bevy gallery and deployed Bevy Gym
page. The deployment offers three Classic Control environments. Started fresh
CartPole training and observed replay collection, then paused it. No optimizer
update was observed. The preview reports `visible: false`; the page reports
`visibilityState: visible`. Foreground training speed remains unverified.
The preview resize tool failed for mobile dimensions, so mobile visual review is
still pending. Historical browser qualification is not current audit evidence.

A temporary asset viewer serves only `runs/quality-research/media` at
`http://100.105.254.50:8766/drone-viewer.html` through
`bevy-gym-drone-viewer-lan-20261008.service`. It is an inspection page, not a
published example. The next visual checkpoint must show the Bevy physics state.

## Published checkpoints

- `2843952`: roadmap and initial audit. GitHub
  [CI run 37809258024](https://github.com/sagan-software/bevy-gym/actions/runs/37809258024) passed.
- `9cc5672`: inspected visual references. GitHub
  [CI run 37819131154](https://github.com/sagan-software/bevy-gym/actions/runs/37819131154) passed.
- `5b4a87c`: remove dependency-only example imports. Committed locally.
- `f268233`: isolate automatic resets and seed schedules. Committed locally.
- Drone foundation is preparing for publication. Verify the remote before reporting
  any of these three source checkpoints as pushed.

## Local evidence and active validation

Another agent freed disk space. This run has not removed shared Cargo caches.
Builds, targets, logs, and reference media live under
`/home/sagan/.cache/bevy-gym-quality-validation/`. The `/dev/shm/bevy-gym-quality-*`
paths are symlinks to those directories. Recreate them after a reboot. Builds use
four jobs, or two for coverage/WASM, with development and test debug information off.

Detached units use `bevy-gym-*-20261008.service`. A passed unit has
`SubState=exited` and `ExecMainStatus=0`; status zero while running is not a pass.
Logs append across reruns, so read the final invocation. Both `bevy-gym-quality-ci-remainder-20261008` and
`bevy-gym-drone-guides-20261008` passed. No validation unit remains running.
Full coverage uses `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` only for nightly branch instrumentation.
The command and output scopes are retained in the coverage record.

Research downloads are under ignored `runs/quality-research/`; durable source URLs,
revisions, hashes, and conclusions are committed. Do not depend on ignored files
as the only record of a completed check. `HANDOFF.md` has ten pre-existing `MD060`
table diagnostics; this run's handoff notice does not change those tables.

## Pending audit areas

Public configuration validation and global tick-rate behavior; asynchronous response
correlation; all environment transitions; trainer numerical correctness; recurrence
and multi-agent accounting; checkpoint validation; worker cancellation and stale
results; rendering fidelity; asset integrity; tutorial paths; complete CI and gallery.

## Handoff update rule

Show screenshots and short videos at each visual checkpoint. Label source references,
asset inspection, simulations, and learned-policy recordings accurately. The user
explicitly requested regular visual updates on 2026-10-08.

After each checkpoint, record its commit, pushed revision, CI/deployment outcome,
tests and exact coverage gaps, visual artifacts, learning evidence, blockers, and
one concrete next action. Keep the goal active until the entire roadmap is done.
